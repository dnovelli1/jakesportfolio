# Updated Coding Portfolio

It's time for another profile update! Over the last month I have begun to work with full stack applications. Diving right into the work with databases and creating the connection between front-end development and backend. I needed to update my portfolio with some of my new work. Unfortunately some of the assignments are done through the console, so I had to leave a few out. As soon as they are deployed I will be sure to enter them into the carousel.
